This bot is based on the [Guys bot for GitHub](https://glitch.com/~guys-bot) and the idea that emerged from [twitter](https://twitter.com/stefanjudis/status/1072066478114070529). Here's the <a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/6/11/8761227/you-guys-sexism-language">article</a> that gives some background. 

While the twitter thread suggested to add this functionality to Slackbot, I wanted to have bot that didn't correct people publicly in the [Sanity Slack Community](htttps://slack.sanity.io), since I suspect most people doesn't use it intentionally to exclude.

You should be able to install this bot in your own slack team by following the instructions, and [going here](https://guys-bot-for-slack.glitch.me/).
